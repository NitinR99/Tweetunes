# tweetunes

Fork of https://github.com/mustafaAlwindawi/tweetunes, where I worked on the front end website design and twitter login implementation using OAuth

Tweetunes provides a unique service to its user. Once you log into Tweetunes, the web application will read your tweets and understand the sentiments behind them, to generate a one-of-a-kind spotify playlist.
